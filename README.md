# Asteroids

This game is run on processing 3.5.3 and was my first ever coding project so it might be a little buggy! 
Make sure you have all of the files in one folder when you download it and ensure that you open "Asteroids_Final_Game.pde"

Single player mode: 

Arrow keys are used for movement and the down key is for firing bullets. Like the classic asteroids game, you can't move backwards, instead you can only move forward while changing the angle of your velocity 

Multiplayer mode: 

Player 1 controls are the same, player 2 uses WASD instead, with 'S' being the shoot button. 

The aim of the game is to clear the playing field of asteroids, and then try to ram each other using the charged ram function. When you initiate ram, you'll become stationary (but you can still aim) and a charging circle will appear. Once it completes and you let go of the button, **your whole ship will fire forward!** Try to hit the other player for a quick win - be careful though, if you hit an asteroid you'll lose a life! 

(Ram for player 1 is the ENTER key and ram for player 2 is the 'R' key)

Ping me if you find any bugs!
